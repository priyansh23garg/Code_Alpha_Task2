# Code_Alpha_Task3
# Fibonacci Generator

This Python script generates a Fibonacci sequence based on user input. Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the size of the Fibonacci series you want to generate.
3. The script will output the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified size.

## How it Works

The script defines a function `fibonacci_generator(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and generates a Fibonacci sequence of size `n`. It initializes an empty list `fib_sequence` to store the Fibonacci numbers. Then, using a `for` loop, it calculates Fibonacci numbers and appends them to the `fib_sequence` list. Finally, the function returns the list of Fibonacci numbers.
